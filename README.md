# hardware-adventures-for-software-enthusiasts

## Meetup Intro 
Are you a software developer / enthusiast and you want to dive into the world of IoT? Are you interested in creating your first (or second or third, …) IoT project whilst learning different ways to programme ESP8266? “Internet of Things, hardware stuff, connected somethings” are everywhere! Come and prepare yourself for the future and learn the fundamentals and more of IoT.    By building a simple prototype for a door sensor alarm, this session will guide you through 3 different ways to programme an ESP8266, a low-cost microchip with WiFi capabilities. Although software development experience is recommended, code examples will be given. This way we can focus on the steps involved to set up, create, run and test your first IoT project.  During this session you will learn about the fundamentals of creating an IoT project, as well as going into more depth with programming microcontrollers.
